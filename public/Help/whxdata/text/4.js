These users can access MyScheduler by clicking ","Schedule > MyScheduler"," in the Facility Scheduler navigation bar. ","\n  ","Click the ","Facility Scheduler"," button in the main navigation bar to return to the Facility Scheduler application. ","\n  ","\n  ","MyScheduler utilizes the HCA single sign-on database to provide access.

The ","Schedule Period Commitment","    progress bar updates as you add and drop shifts for a schedule including during self-scheduling periods and posted schedules. ","\n  ","Your commitment is calculated per pay period rather than by week.
